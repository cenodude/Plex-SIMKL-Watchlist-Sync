![Plex ‚áÑ SIMKL Watchlist Sync](Plex-SIMKL.jpg)

Keep your **Plex Watchlist** and **SIMKL ‚ÄúPlan to Watch‚Äù** list aligned.  
This tool compares both lists and applies additions/removals so they end up in sync ‚Äî safely and predictably.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- **Two-way sync** between Plex and SIMKL.
- **Plex writes use `plexapi` ** (add/remove)
- **Read fallback for Plex**: If `plexapi` cannot read your Plex Watchlist (example: temporary upstream change),
  the script **falls back to Plex Discover HTTP** for *read-only* watchlist fetching. Writes still use `plexapi`.
- **Clear modes**:
  - **`two-way` (default)** ‚Äî symmetric sync.  
    - **First run:** *adds only* (seeds a local snapshot to avoid accidental deletes).  
    - **Subsequent runs:** *adds and deletions* both ways, based on deltas vs the snapshot.
  - **`mirror`** ‚Äî make one side exactly match the other (adds + deletions) using `source_of_truth` (`plex` or `simkl`).
- **Built-in SIMKL OAuth redirect helper** (`--init-simkl redirect`) to obtain tokens easily.

---

## üß© How it works

1. Read Plex Watchlist (via `plexapi`, or Discover HTTP as a **read-only** fallback) and SIMKL PTW.
2. Build ID sets (IMDB/TMDB/TVDB/slug when available) for stable matching across both services.
3. Compute differences.
4. Apply changes based on your configured mode:
   - **two-way (first run):** add-only on both sides, snapshot saved to `state.json`.
   - **two-way (later runs):** add/remove in both directions using the snapshot to detect deltas.
   - **mirror(plex):** make SIMKL exactly match Plex (add to SIMKL, remove from SIMKL).
   - **mirror(simkl):** make Plex exactly match SIMKL (add/remove in Plex via `plexapi`).

> **Note**: Because Plex write endpoints change occasionally, **writes always go through `plexapi`**. If add/remove fails, upgrade `plexapi` and try again.

---
## üì¶ Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- Python packages: **`requests`**, **`plexapi`**
- PlexAPI 4.17.1 or higher. Validate if you have the correct version or pip install -U plexapi
- A `config.json` next to the script (auto-created on first run)
- A SIMKL application (client id/secret)
- A Plex account token

Install dependencies (same Python environment you‚Äôll run the script in):

```bash
pip install -U requests plexapi
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (`config.json`)

A starter file is created on first run:

```json
{
  "plex": {
    "account_token": ""          // REQUIRED: Your Plex *account* token (not a server token)
  },
  "simkl": {
    "client_id": "",             // REQUIRED: SIMKL API Client ID (from creating an app in SIMKL)
    "client_secret": "",         // REQUIRED: SIMKL API Client Secret
    "access_token": "",          // Leave blank; script fills after OAuth
    "refresh_token": "",         // Leave blank; script fills after OAuth
    "token_expires_at": 0        // Leave as 0; script manages expiry time (unix epoch seconds)
  },
  "sync": {
    "enable_add": true,          // Allow adding missing items
    "enable_remove": true,       // Allow removing extras (used in mirror and two-way w/ deletions)
    "verify_after_write": true,  // Re-read both sides after changes to confirm counts
    "bidirectional": {
      "enabled": true,           // Enable bi-directional sync
      "mode": "two-way",         // "two-way" (union/adds; deletions when state exists) or "mirror"
      "source_of_truth": "plex"  // Used only for "mirror": "plex" or "simkl"
    }
  },
  "runtime": {
    "debug": false               // Set true for verbose logs
  }
}
```

### Keys

- `plex.account_token`: Your Plex account token (see ‚ÄúGetting a Plex token‚Äù below).
- `simkl.*`: Credentials and tokens for SIMKL.
- `sync.enable_add` / `sync.enable_remove`: Global toggles for adding/removing.
- `sync.verify_after_write`: Reserved for future verification logic.
- `bidirectional.enabled`: `true` ‚Üí two-way or mirror; `false` ‚Üí one-way Plex ‚Üí SIMKL.
- `bidirectional.mode`:
  - `"two-way"` ‚Äî symmetric, with state snapshot and real deletions after first run.
  - `"mirror"` ‚Äî make one side exactly match the other using `source_of_truth`.
- `bidirectional.source_of_truth`: `"plex"` or `"simkl"` (used only in `mirror`).

## üîê SIMKL OAuth (built-in helper)

This script spins up a tiny local HTTP server to complete OAuth and save tokens into `config.json`.

### 1) Create your SIMKL app
- Go to **simkl.com ‚Üí Developers** and create an app.
- Add the **exact** redirect URI you will use (must match what you launch the helper with):
  ```
  http://<HOST>:8787/callback
  ```
  > `<HOST>` must be reachable from the browser you‚Äôll use to authorize (server IP/hostname for headless, or `127.0.0.1` for same-device).

---

## Choose your setup

### A) Headless server (Docker/NAS/VPS) ‚Äî authorize from another device
Use this when the script runs on a machine without a local browser.

1. **Run the helper on the server** (no `--open`):
   ```
   ./plex_simkl_watchlist_sync.py --init-simkl redirect --bind 0.0.0.0:8787
   ```
2. The script prints a **Callback URL** and an **authorization link**.
3. In your SIMKL app settings, make sure the Redirect URI uses the server‚Äôs real IP/hostname, e.g.:
   ```
   http://192.168.1.50:8787/callback
   ```
4. **On your laptop/phone**, open the printed authorization link, grant access, and wait for the ‚ÄúSuccess!‚Äù page.
5. Tokens are saved to `config.json` on the server. You can stop the helper after it says the code was handled.

**Notes**
- If using Docker, expose the port: `-p 8787:8787`.
- Ensure firewalls allow inbound TCP **8787** from your browser device.
- You must replace `0.0.0.0` with a specific interface IP if you prefer.

---

### B) Same device (desktop/laptop) ‚Äî helper opens your browser locally
Use this when you run the script and complete OAuth on the **same** machine.

1. **Run the helper with localhost and auto-open**:
   ```
   ./plex_simkl_watchlist_sync.py --init-simkl redirect --bind 127.0.0.1:8787 --open
   ```
2. Complete SIMKL login/consent in the browser tab that opens.
3. Tokens are stored in `config.json` next to the script.

**Notes**
- Add this Redirect URI to your SIMKL app if you use the command above:
  ```
  http://127.0.0.1:8787/callback
  ```
  (You can also use `http://localhost:8787/callback` if you bind to `localhost`.)
- If port **8787** is busy, pick another port and use it **both** in `--bind` and in the SIMKL app Redirect URI.

---

### After successful auth
You‚Äôll see logs like:
```
[i] Redirect helper is running
Callback URL: http://<HOST>:8787/callback
...
[‚úì] Code handled; tokens saved if exchange succeeded.
```

`config.json` will now contain `simkl.access_token` (and `refresh_token` if provided).

Run your sync normally:
```
./plex_simkl_watchlist_sync.py --sync
```


## üéü Getting a Plex account token

1. Open **https://app.plex.tv** and sign in.
2. Open your browser **Developer Tools ‚Üí Network** tab.
3. Refresh the page and click any request to `app.plex.tv` / API endpoints.
4. Look for the query/header **`X-Plex-Token`** ‚Äî copy its value.
5. Paste it into `config.json` ‚Üí `plex.account_token`.

> If you rotate sessions or sign out, your token may change; update `config.json` accordingly.

# Initialize SIMKL tokens (local redirect helper on port 8787)
./plex_simkl_watchlist_sync.py --init-simkl redirect --bind 0.0.0.0:8787

# Run a sync (shows banner then [i] logs)
./plex_simkl_watchlist_sync.py --sync

# One-off override of Plex token
./plex_simkl_watchlist_sync.py --sync --plex-account-token YOUR_TOKEN

# Print versions
./plex_simkl_watchlist_sync.py --version
```

### CLI flags

```
--sync                         Run synchronization using config.json
--init-simkl redirect          Start local redirect helper for SIMKL OAuth
--bind HOST:PORT               Bind address for redirect helper (default 0.0.0.0:8787)

```

---

## üîÅ Modes in detail

### `two-way` (default)
- **First run:** The script builds `state.json` from the current lists and performs **adds only** on both sides (no deletes) to avoid accidental loss.
- **Next runs:** The script compares current lists to `state.json` and applies **adds and deletions** in both directions.  
  If you **delete** something on SIMKL, it will be removed on Plex; if you **add** something on Plex, it will be added to SIMKL, etc.

> To **re-seed** (e.g., after a major change), delete `state.json` and run again. The first run will be add-only.

### `mirror`
- `source_of_truth: plex` ‚Äî SIMKL will be made to match Plex (adds + deletions on SIMKL).
- `source_of_truth: simkl` ‚Äî Plex will be made to match SIMKL (adds + deletions on Plex via `plexapi`).

### One-way
- Set `bidirectional.enabled` to `false` to do Plex ‚Üí SIMKL only.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Files the script writes

- `config.json` ‚Äî your configuration + SIMKL tokens.
- `state.json` ‚Äî local snapshot that enables **real two-way deletions** on subsequent runs.

> If `state.json` is missing, the script treats the run as ‚Äúfirst run‚Äù and does **adds only**.

---

# üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

## Out-of-sync or repeated `NOT EQUAL`
If a run fails partway or the two lists drift (e.g., you see `Post-sync: Plex=X vs SIMKL=Y ‚Üí NOT EQUAL` on repeats), do a safe reset + one-time mirror, then return to two-way:

**1) Reset local snapshot**
```bash
./plex_simkl_watchlist_sync.py --reset-state
```
This removes `state.json` so the next run reseeds cleanly.

**2) Temporarily switch to MIRROR mode**  
Open `config.json` and set the sync block like this (pick *one* source of truth):
```json
"sync": {
  "enable_add": true,
  "enable_remove": true,
  "bidirectional": {
    "enabled": true,
    "mode": "mirror",
    "source_of_truth": "plex"   // or "simkl"
  },
  "activity": {
    "use_activity": true
  }
}
```
- `"plex"` = make **SIMKL match Plex** (adds/removes on SIMKL).
- `"simkl"` = make **Plex match SIMKL** (adds/removes on Plex).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Mirror is **destructive** on the target side (it will remove extras). Choose the direction carefully.

**3) Run a one-time mirror**
```bash
./plex_simkl_watchlist_sync.py --sync --debug
```
Confirm the final line shows `‚Üí EQUAL`.

**4) Switch back to two-way**
Edit `config.json` again:
```json
"bidirectional": {
  "enabled": true,
  "mode": "two-way",
  "source_of_truth": "plex"
}
```
Then run:
```bash
./plex_simkl_watchlist_sync.py --sync
```
This saves a fresh snapshot (`state.json`) once counts match.

---

## `plexapi` not installed or too old
Error mentions plexapi or an unsupported call. Fix by upgrading in the **same** Python environment:
```bash
pip install -U plexapi
```

## Plex watchlist 404 via `plexapi`
- You may see errors like ‚ÄúSection 'watchlist' not found!‚Äù.
- The script will **automatically fall back** to **Plex Discover HTTP** *for reading only*.
- **Writes to Plex still require `plexapi`**. If add/remove fails, upgrade `plexapi`.

## Plex add/remove fails (400/404)
Usually a sign `plexapi` needs an update for the latest Plex Discover endpoints. Upgrade:
```bash
pip install -U plexapi
```

## SIMKL 401/403
Your SIMKL access token may be expired or the client credentials are wrong.
- Re-run the OAuth helper and ensure the **redirect URI** in SIMKL matches the one printed by the script.

## Redirect helper unreachable
- Ensure any container/VM port mappings allow inbound to the chosen port (default `8787`).
- If binding `0.0.0.0`, the helper prints a URL you can open from another device on the network.
